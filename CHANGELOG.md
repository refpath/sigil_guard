## Unreleased Breaking Changes For 1.0.0

SigilGuard 1.0 is a deliberate breaking release. Apply
[`MIGRATING-1.0.md`](MIGRATING-1.0.md) before moving a 0.2.x consumer to the
1.0 line.

- Hardened trust-bundle authority transitions, concurrent rollback floors and
  cumulative revocations. Successors changing delegated authority require the
  new root quorum to countersign; revoked or expired card issuers fail closed.
- Fixed cold security modules, actor/tool policy facts, MCP object-key scanning,
  full replay retention, atomic rate quotas and bounded untrusted work/state.
- Rejected ambiguous null-valued application map fields while preserving v3
  signed bytes. See the [audit acceptance changes](MIGRATING-1.0.md#audit-hardening-of-v3-acceptance).
- Fixed overlapping redaction, unbounded streaming candidates, UTF-8 chunk
  boundaries and JCS float formatting. Added independent float vectors,
  measured scanner improvements and comparable performance regression gates.
- Updated development dependencies including Mint 1.10.0 security fixes and
  Muex 0.9.1. Mutation reports distinguish killed, compiler-invalid and proven
  equivalent mutations; broader bounded security campaigns retain strict scores.
- Added strict deployment guidance and a fresh unpacked-Hex consumer check.

- Removed `SigilGuard.Registry`, `SigilGuard.Registry.Bundle`, and
  `SigilGuard.Registry.Cache`; use
  [`SigilGuard.TrustBundle`](MIGRATING-1.0.md#registry-to-trust-bundles).
- Removed `SigilGuard.Envelope` and verdict-only `_sigil` metadata; use
  [`SigilGuard.Attestation`](MIGRATING-1.0.md#envelope-to-attestation) and
  [`_agent_trust`](MIGRATING-1.0.md#mcp-trust-metadata).
- Removed `SigilGuard.Profile`; use
  [`SigilGuard.TrustProfile`](MIGRATING-1.0.md#profile-to-trustprofile).
- Removed legacy config keys including `:backend`, `:protocol_profile`, and all
  `registry_*` keys; see
  [Configuration Keys](MIGRATING-1.0.md#configuration-keys).
- Renamed policy files from the old SIGIL family to the
  [SIGILGUARD policy filenames](MIGRATING-1.0.md#policy-filenames).
- Renamed confirmation metadata from `_sigil_confirmation` to
  [`_agent_confirmation`](MIGRATING-1.0.md#mcp-confirmation-metadata).
- Aligned the embedded gateway with MCP v2 (`2026-07-28`): structured action
  binding now covers nested keys and non-string values, modern successful
  responses carry `resultType`, and MRTR inputs/state remain bound across
  retries. See [MCP v2](MIGRATING-1.0.md#mcp-v2-2026-07-28).
- Moved gateway denial codes outside JSON-RPC's reserved server-error band to
  the application-defined
  [`-31990..-31984` range](MIGRATING-1.0.md#mcp-json-rpc-rejection-codes);
  the pre-release `-32050..-32056` draft allocation never ships.
- Upgraded capability manifests to
  `sigil_guard_capability_manifest/v2`, binding tool titles, icons, MCP Apps
  UI visibility, and validated `x-mcp-header` annotations.
- Added offline MCP Apps boundaries: same-server app/model visibility checks
  and `SigilGuard.MCP.AppResource` verification for pinned UI bytes, declared
  CSP domains, dedicated app domains, and browser permissions. Verification is
  strictly optioned and bounded to 1 MiB by default; rendering remains
  host-owned.
- Added `SigilGuard.Assessment.OSCAL.project/2`, a pure optional OSCAL
  Assessment Results v1.2.3 observation projection that binds a host-pinned
  canonical audit-export digest, rejects dangling fragment/query-only
  locators, and never infers findings or control satisfaction.
- Removed Finch from the runtime dependency set; HTTP anchor stores use the
  host-provided `SigilGuard.HTTPClient` behaviour.
- Runtime dependencies are intentionally limited to `:telemetry`,
  `:nimble_options`, and `:jason`; integrations, notebooks, and adaptive
  detector examples add no runtime dependency, and `mix deps.audit` is clean
  for the 1.0.0 release line. The test-only Bypass/Cowboy tree currently
  resolves Cowlib 2.19.0, for which Hex reports CVE-2026-43966 and
  CVE-2026-43969, plus CVE-2026-43971 published on 2026-08-18; Cowlib is absent
  from the production dependency tree, all three advisories are explicitly
  acknowledged in the Hex project configuration, affected encoders are not
  called by SigilGuard, and no patched Hex release is available as of
  2026-08-19. The canonical gate runs both `mix deps.audit` and
  `mix hex.audit`. Recheck the exceptions before 2026-09-19 and immediately
  before release, whichever comes first.
- Added a canonical full-history secret scan using a pinned,
  checksum-verified Gitleaks binary. Its ignore file contains only exact
  fingerprints for reviewed synthetic scanner fixtures.
- Malformed hook lists, adaptive-detector modules, and timeout options now fail
  closed at direct policy and runtime-gate entry points instead of allowing an
  invalid `receive ... after` timeout to raise.
- Repo and boundary-policy loaders now validate option containers, keys,
  candidate sets, legacy mappings, and byte limits before filesystem access;
  malformed inputs return `:invalid_options` instead of raising or weakening
  the configured size bound.
- Tagged publication now fails closed unless GitHub reports the exact release
  ref as protected; release documentation distinguishes the environment named
  in workflow YAML from the required owner-managed reviewer, deployment-tag,
  and environment-secret protections.
- Added an unoptimized, 100%-threshold mutation gate for the pure verdict
  ordering primitive; all 78 compilable mutants are killed.
- SPDX generation now binds the declared license from each matching locked Hex
  runtime artifact and fails on missing, malformed, or version-mismatched
  dependency metadata instead of emitting `NOASSERTION`.
- Boundary hook telemetry now covers successful and failed invocations with a
  native-time duration measurement and a normalized `hook_result`, matching the
  observability contract instead of reporting failures only.
- Reconciled the profile, gateway, and boundary specs to the final 1.0 event
  families and made boundary-policy decision telemetry use the shared policy
  shape with a system-time measurement.
- MCP gateway decision telemetry now fires after protocol/result enrichment on
  success and pre-gate denial paths; protocol revision and result type remain
  opt-in high-cardinality OpenTelemetry attributes.
- Revalidated reader-facing research and specification links, replacing moved
  SLSA, NIST, IETF, llm-guard, mcp-use, and historical crate references.
- Expanded `notebooks/` into an eleven-chapter, offline-validated Livebook
  tutorial track with conference/workshop run sheets, a deterministic AI-agent
  attack replay, and an optional ReqLLM proposal path using Livebook secrets;
  the canonical quality gate now executes every shipped Elixir cell offline.
- Changed selected trust-bundle error atoms and config boot errors; see
  [Error Changes](MIGRATING-1.0.md#error-changes).
- Version adoption is explicit: `~> 0.2` remains on the 0.2.x line and
  `~> 1.0` adopts the 1.0 release line; see
  [Version Pinning](MIGRATING-1.0.md#version-pinning).
